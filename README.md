# Pomodoro - JavaScript

A pomodoro app to train with multiple things, basics of JS I need to learn.

Two timers are available. First one is the time (= 30 minutes) you work. The second one is the rest timer.
When you click one the 'work' button, the first timer starts. When it reaches 0, the rest timer starts. When this one also reaches 0, timers are reset, and it starts again.
If you want to take a rest, you can click one the rest button, and click again to make the timer to continue. You can also reset everything with the last button.


## Things I learned
  
  - how to create a timer, and how to make it reaches 0.
  - how to use setInterval();
  - more DOM manipulation.
